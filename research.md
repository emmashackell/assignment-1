I found an article called "Goal Setting and Student Achievement: A Longitudinal Study". This article talked about the goals of a spanish class which does not have much to do with my goals but what caught my eye was this quote "achievement is measured by doing better than others and more importantly, the recognition that results from such superior achievement". I chose to talk about the motivation behind my goals and the motivation behind the goals of the students in the article. My goals are not measured by recognition or doing things better than others. My goals that I came up with today are measured by what I think will make me happy and successful in my future.
